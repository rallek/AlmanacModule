# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Copy RKAlmanacModule into your `modules` directory. Afterwards you should have a folder named `modules/RK/AlmanacModule/Resources`.
2. Initialize and activate RKAlmanacModule in the extensions administration.
3. Move or copy the directory `Resources/userdata/RKAlmanacModule/` to `/userdata/RKAlmanacModule/`.
   Note this step is optional as the install process can create these folders, too.
4. Make the directory `/userdata/RKAlmanacModule/` writable including all sub folders.
